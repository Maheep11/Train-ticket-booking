# 🚆 MyTrain – Train Ticket Booking Platform

**MyTrain** is a personal project created with observation, curiosity, and a passion for learning web development. The goal is to build a simple and functional train ticket booking platform that includes:

- ✅ Ticket booking interface  
- 📍 Live train tracking (coming soon)  
- 🔮 Ticket confirmation prediction (coming soon)  

---

- (Upcoming: APIs, possibly backend integration)

## 👨‍💻 About This Project

This is a **self-made project**, developed completely by me based on how real-world train booking platforms work. I studied existing platforms, understood the flow, and recreated the logic and UI in my own way — no tutorials, no copying.

It's not perfect — but it's a learning journey. 💡
